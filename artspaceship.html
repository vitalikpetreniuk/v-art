										<p>Every day I faced problems of creative people, their ignorance/newness of legal issues, their problems with dealers, promoters, gallery owners and other intermediaries who did not prescribe the framework of cooperation in the contract, did not adhere to oral agreements and created unconscionability for artists. There were also opposite situations when the artist allowed themselves to cheat on a professional mediator or art manager, not to adhere to the agreement.</p>
										<p>Despite mentioned problems, there is the main one – Ukrainian art market is local, it doesn’t have necessary potential for scaling the artist, his access to a global audience. Over the years of practice, I have developed an understanding how to integrate Ukrainian into a global context, to develop the secondary market, to form a culture of intellectual property and understanding the value of a creative product.</p>
										<p>The development of technologies and digitalization processes have forced to look towards the automation of many processes that would facilitate the artist's work. My ideal is a democratic self-regulated market with the proper rules, where the cooperation of the gallery and the artist is a win-win/mutually beneficial process of moving towards, not establishing a monopoly on creativity.</p>
										<p>I explained my ideas to Roman Minin, one of the pioneers of digital art in Ukraine. As it turned out, he also had a similar idea. This way, at one moment the V-Art project was born, the name of which, we also came up with together. After that there were days, weeks and months of teamwork, brainstorming, until the startup V-Art appeared, with already functioning application for virtual exhibitions.
